Fortune Cookies for AmigaOS

This is a very old program, written 25 years ago for AmigaOS. It is an implmentation of the venerable UNIX fortune cookie
program and as far as I can tell/remember accepts regular UNIX fortune cookie files. 

It is implemented as an Amiga commodity. The cookie window can be summoned (by default) with `Amiga-Space` key combination.
This can be changed through the Amiga `tooltypes` system. It also has an AREXX port and is fully documented in an AmigaGuide file.

To install, copy the `Epigrams` file and `Epigrams.info` file into `WBStartup`
(or whichever drawer you prefer). Also, make sure there is an `epigrams.dat`
file in the S: drive.

ASCII art by Tango created today. Here's the original from 25 years ago that I never used. Thanks.
